# Simple Digital Clock for Windows Console
 Description: This C program utilizes the Windows API to create a simple digital clock in the console. 
 The user sets the initial time, and the program continuously updates and displays the time in HH:MM:SS format. 
 It includes a 1-second delay between updates for a realistic time passage effect. The console screen is cleared before each update to create a smooth display.
